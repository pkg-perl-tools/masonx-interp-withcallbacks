MasonX/Interp/WithCallbacks version 1.17
========================================

MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks subclasses HTML::Mason::Interp in order to
provide a Mason callback system built on Params::CallbackRequest. Callbacks
may be either code references provided to the C<new()> constructor, or methods
defined in subclasses of Params::Callback. Callbacks are triggered either for
every request or by specially named keys in the Mason request arguments, and
all callbacks are executed at the beginning of a request, just before Mason
creates and executes the request component stack.

This module brings support for a sort of plugin architecture based on
Params::CallbackRequest to Mason. Mason then executes code before executing
any components. This approach allows you to carry out logical processing of
data submitted from a form, to affect the contents of the Mason request
arguments (and thus the %ARGS hash in components), and even to redirect or
abort the request before Mason handles it.
