Revision history for Perl extension MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks.

1.10  
      - Code moved over from MasonX::ApacheHandler::WithCallbacks, which is
        deprecated. Differences from that class are as follows.
      - Callback handling code from MasonX::ApacheHandler::WithCallbacks has
        been migrated to Params::CallbackRequest.
      - Code from MasonX::CallbackHandler has been migrated to
        Params::Callback.
      - MasonX::CallbackTester has been removed, since it isn't necessary
        in a non-mod_perl environment.
      - Params::CallbackRequest::Exceptions supplies the exceptions thrown by
        Params::CallbackRequest, since that module is not strictly connected
        to Mason.
      - Changed the C<request_args()> accessor from that was in
        MasonX::CallbackHandler to C<params()> in Params::Callback, to reflect
        the idea that this is a generic parameter-triggered callback
        architecture.
      - Replaced teh C<ah()> accessor, since the callback controller isn't
        a Mason ApacheHandler anymore, with C<cb_request()> in Params::Callback.
      - Added C<cb_request() accessor to MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks.
