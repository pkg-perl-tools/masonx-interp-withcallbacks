Revision history for Perl extension MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks.

1.10  Mon Sep  8 21:15:42 2003
      - Code moved over from MasonX::ApacheHandler::WithCallbacks, which is
        deprecated. Differences from that class are as follows.
      - Callback handling code from MasonX::ApacheHandler::WithCallbacks has
        been migrated to Params::CallbackRequest.
      - Code from MasonX::CallbackHandler has been migrated to
        Params::Callback.
      - MasonX::CallbackTester has been removed, since it isn't necessary
        in a non-mod_perl environment.
      - Params::CallbackRequest::Exceptions supplies the exceptions thrown by
        Params::CallbackRequest, since that module is not strictly connected
        to Mason.
      - Changed the request_args() accessor from MasonX::CallbackHandler to
        params() in Params::Callback, to reflect the idea that this is a
        generic parameter-triggered callback architecture.
      - Replaced the ah() accessor, since the callback controller isn't a
        Mason ApacheHandler anymore, with cb_request() in Params::Callback.
      - Added cb_request() accessor to MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks.
      - Replaced the "exec_null_cb_values" parameter from
        MasonX::ApacheHandler::WithCallbaks, which had defaulted to true, with
        "ignore_nulls" in Params::CallbackRequest, which defaults to false.
      - Added Params::CallbackRequest notes() interface, which copies all
        notes to the Mason request notes() interface before the request
        executes.
